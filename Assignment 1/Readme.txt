1.Implement the Sequencer class that was discussed in the lecture.
2.Write a program that creates a number of threads that each repeatedly invoke the getNext method.  Make sure that all the threads are using the same Sequencer object.
3.Figure out a way to test the program to detect any concurrency errors that may have occurred.  Formulating this as a Junit test is recommended.
4.Experiment with number of threads and number of iterations per thread and figure out what parameters will result in an error being displayed in most runs.
